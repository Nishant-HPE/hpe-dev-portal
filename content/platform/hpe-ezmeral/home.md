## Get started with HPE Ezmeral Software

The HPE Ezmeral Early Access (EEA) program lets developers try new products before they’re released. With exemplary training and support provided by HPE, developers get real-time, hands-on experience with new products, features and capabilities to solve advanced data and analytics problems. A key element of the EEA program is the feedback we’ll collect from developers, providing input to the product roadmap and helping ensure it continues to evolve with our customers’ needs.

The first two products that are available through EEA are:

* [HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric Software](https://home.hpe-df.com/) (GLDF) – a managed service that provides a fully deployed, configured and managed single global name space to aggregate heterogeneous data stores from a single interface    

* [HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software]( https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-ezmeral-unified-analytics.html#EEAUA) (UA) – HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software provides a curated, managed set of popular open-source frameworks targeting workloads in data engineering, large scale data analytics, BI Reporting and exploratory data science, AI, and ML.

The following overview videos are available to provide more information on EEA and the first two products:
